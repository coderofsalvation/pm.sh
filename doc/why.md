Similar like coffeescript, powscript is just a bash dialect which transpiles to bash.
It can turn huge codebases into a smaller readable one.

* Less noise, more readable
* Make it easy to write bash applications without too much hassle
* Some people prefer memorizing a minilanguage over bash code snippets/manuals/wikis
* bash evolves slowly, which is good for stability reasons. Powscript will always be backwards compatible.

The aim of powscript is to keep the transpiler small & fast.
Therefore not all ideas will be suitable (json parser e.g.)
